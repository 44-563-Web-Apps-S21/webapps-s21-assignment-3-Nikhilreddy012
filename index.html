    <h3>Playing Cricket</h3>
    <p>
      There are 11 players in a team of cricket. 
      The bowler bowls the ball and the batsmen has to hit the ball with the bat. 
      You can run between the wickets after hitting or get 4 or 6 runs if the ball reaches the boundary. 
      The team which scores more number of runs wins the game. 
      <b>Cricket is undoubtedly the biggest sport in India</b> and I always love playing it. 
      Sachin Tendulkar who is also known as the <b>God of cricket</b> is my all time favourite player. 
      He has made me like the sport even more.
